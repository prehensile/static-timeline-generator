# Tellybox: Nine Speculative Prototypes For Future TV

_Miller, L. et al. (2017)_

> We have developed nine speculative ("half-resolution") prototypes as part of our project to explore future possibilities for television experiences as widely as possible. The prototypes are physical representations of our research into why people watch television and what they like and dislike about it. Their physicality improves engagement and quality of feedback, at low cost.

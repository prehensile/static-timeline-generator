# The Inspection Chamber

An original interactive comedy science fiction audio drama pilot for voice devices, made in collaboration with a leading independent radio drama producer, where you play a part in the action using your own voice.

This was the first product the BBC released for Amazon Alexa, and we had lots of positive feedback from users, the industry, and in the press. 

I designed and led the project, did some early experience prototyping, and was its lead producer.

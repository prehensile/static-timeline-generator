# The Inspection Chamber

An interactive science fiction comedy story for Amazon Alexa and (coming soon to) Google Home in the vein of Douglas Adams, Franz Kafka and Portal, where you play a part in the action using your own voice. We’re calling it ‘conversational radio’ until we come up with something better!

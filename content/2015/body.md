# The Body

In December 2014, working with Tim Burrell-Saward as ELK, we helped renowned experimental theatre duo Nigel Barrett and Louise Mari to win the The Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award for "The Body": an intimate, immersive theatrical performance.

We were tasked with peppering the performance with discreet technologies designed to help stimulate senses and provoke responses from the unaware audience. These technologies included peripheral vision LED screens, sub-bass chairs, live heart-rate-to-sound conversion and projection mapping.

In November 2015 the concept was developed into a breathtaking full performance which enjoyed a sold-out run at the Barbican in London and was described by The Guardian as "a seat-shaking, soul-searching techno-futurist experience".

# Pastcards

Pastcards was a boutique, arty little service I ran from to November 2015 October 2017. Every month subscribers would recieve a physical postcard in the mail, featuring an image from their personal Instagram feed picked by a tasteful robot.

The image chosen remained a mystery to people until it arrived on their doormat; I was playing with the delightfulness of a surprise postcard in the mail, plus a kind of de-ephemeralisation of otherwise disposable social media posts.

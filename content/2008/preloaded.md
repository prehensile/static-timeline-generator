# Preloaded

My second London agency job. I worked at Preloaded from 2006 - 2008 as a Flash developer, building games and microsites.

After leaving in 2008, I went [freelance](#tag-freelance) as a Flash and iPhone developer and [creative technologist](#tag-creative-technologist) until [joining BBC R&D in 2016](#bbc-rd).

# tl;dr: using LLMs as research tools

In early 2024, my team and I at BBC R&D spent some time building research tools powered by large language models. We wanted to find out if they could help with our work analysing research interviews, and in a project we had exploring trend analysis and collective intelligence.

We found that they were _really_ useful for some use cases, especially summarising and tagging material, but we had to develop some pretty elaborate strategies to prevent them from hallucinating data which didn't exist. Not ideal in a research context!

# Welcome

This is a timeline of selected projects, jobs, and other things I've done with computers [since the year 2000](#codemasters). It's intended to give an overview of the kinds of things I've done and where my interests and experience lie.

You can filter which entries are displayed with the selector at the top right of this page. If you're pressed for time, there's a [greatest-hits](#greatest-hits) category.

There's links to various other bits of me [here](/).

# Foom: A Strategic Simulation

In January 2025 I joined the creative team behind Foom, an immersive strategic simulation designed to engage participants in exploring the future of artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impact. It's part foresight workshop, part immersive theatre show.

I'm building software to run the show across tablet interfaces for participants, live ambient news displays, and the showrunning backend. I'm also helping to shape the experience and game design.

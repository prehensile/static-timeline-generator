# PROJECTIONS: "Things are not normal"

A foresight report produced as Lead Foresight Researcher in BBC R&D's Advisory Team.

My inital brief was to compile a list of technologies and platforms that R&D and the wider BBC should be paying attention to over the next few years. I immediately blew up my own scope by countering: yes, of course, but we should also be looking at the wider social & political contexts in which the BBC's audiences (and the BBC itself) will be operating in those years. To narrow our scope to technologies alone would be missing the whole picture: nobody and no company uses technology in a vacuum, and we need to anticipate the futures in which our audiences will be using technologies in order to design and build products which will be useful to them in those futures.

The report went down very well both inside and outside the BBC; people tell me that it has a depth and concern for big-picture issues like inequalities and the environment that they don't often see in tech (and adjacent) industry foresight reports. Even better, a fair few people have told me that it's inspired a lot of new thinking for them, which is great!

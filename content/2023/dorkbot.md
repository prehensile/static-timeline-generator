# Dorkbot Manchester  

Working with artist [Anthony Hall](https://antonyhall.net/blog/), I restarted Dorkbot Manchester in 2023.

Dorkbot is an international group of meetups for artists, engineers, designers, scientists, inventors, and anyone else working under the broad umbrella of electronic art. Dorkbot meetings aim to nurture a local electronic arts community and to encourage people to talk about the work they're doing, and to foster discussion about that work in a friendly, supportive, informal atmosphere.

# Launchball

A physics-based Flash game I built for the Science Museum during my stint at Preloaded. It eventually racked over 10 million plays, and won a slew of awards, including Best in Show and Best Game at SXSW 2008 and Technical Excellence at Flash in the Can.

I was sole developer on the project, and contributed heavily to the game design.

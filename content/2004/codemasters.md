# Codemasters

I worked at Codemasters in their fledgling Online Marketing department in 2000 and 2004, bookending my university years. My second ever real job, I cranked out a lot of banner ads and microsites as part of the marketing campaigns for their games, but by far the most fun bit was creating viral games in Director and Flash to support those campaigns.

# Dora García, _Twenty-three million, five hundred and eighty-six thousand, four hundred and ninety stories_

I worked with artist Dora García to create this project for the London Bookshop Map iPhone app. The app allows users to generate a short story by pressing a button, which are created by cutting up existing short stories from Dora's previous project, _All the Stories_.  The stories that users create by pressing the button become part of Dora García’s _Twenty-three million, five hundred and eighty-six thousand, four hundred and ninety stories (2013 ‑ ongoing)_ and are updated immediately to a blog.

In 2018, I span the story generator out from the app onto its own standalone website.

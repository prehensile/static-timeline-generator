# Dora García: Segunda Vez / Second Time Around

For a retrospective of Dora Garia's work at MNCARS, Madrid, Dora wanted a version of twenty-three-million stories that would be _'living in the air'_ of the museum, inivisibly, accessable by visitors' mobile phones. Having developed a sensible distrust of Bluetooth, and not wanting to force installation of an app to see the stories, I came up with the idea of staging a digital intervention on the museum's wifi network. Every time a visitor logged on to wifi, they would see a generated story instead of the museum's usual portal page.

Dora liked the idea, so I then worked with museum staff to implement the intervention for the duration of the exhbition.

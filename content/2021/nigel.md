# Looking for Nigel

An interactive story for Bose's AR audio sunglasses. We worked with theatre makers and an artist, writer and placemaker to create a spatial audio story which plays out as a series of waypoints dropped into a nearby park when the app is opened.

I created some early experience prototypes and designed and led the project.

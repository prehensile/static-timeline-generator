# Better Images of AI

Abstract, futuristic or science-fiction-inspired images of AI hinder public understanding of the technologyâ€™s already significant societal and environmental impacts. Images relating machine intelligence to human intelligence set unrealistic expectations and misstate the capabilities of AI. Such images potentially sow fear, and research shows they can be laden with historical assumptions about gender, ethnicity and religion. A new non-profit collaboration are researching, creating, curating and providing Better Images of AI.

I led a joint research project for the Better Images of AI collaboration with London College of Communication, contributed to the website build, and initiated and ran two artist commissions - including sorting out the fine details of licensing images under Creative Commons.

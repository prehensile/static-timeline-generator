# Crystal Bennes, _When Computers Were Women_

_four hand-woven Jacquard wall hangings made of recycled cotton, organic cotton and lambswool, 70cm x 300cm each_

When Computers Were Women is a project connected to feminist critiques of physics, and stems from an invited residency at CERN (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in 2018.

I helped Crystal ingest punch card data from photos she'd taken at CERN and translate that data into a format that could be read by software driving the modern weaving machines.

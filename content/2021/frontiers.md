# Interactive Audio Augmented Reality in Participatory Performance

> This study examines how audio human-computer interaction can prompt and support actions, and how audio AR can contribute to developing new kinds of interactions in participatory performance. It draws from aspects of multi-player audio-only games and interactive storytelling. A user experience study of the performance shows that people are engaged with interactive content and interact and navigate within the spatial audio content using their whole body. The performative aspect was well-received and participants took on roles and responsibilities within their group during the experience.

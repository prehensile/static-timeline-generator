# Philter Phactory

Definitely one of the strangest gigs I've had. My experiments with language-processing bots led to a year or so working for Philter Phactory, whose main product was Weavrs: autonomous social bots.

I wrote 'prosthetics' for the Weavrs which enabled them to generate their own strange broken poetry, and a suite of linguistic 'effects pedals' with which users could give their bots particular accents, stylistic traits or idiosyncracies. I also did a bunch of general backend programming, housekeeping, documentation and playful prototyping. 

In addition, we modified a Teddy Ruxpin doll which we connected to the internet and took to conferences, providing a physical body for the bots to inhabit while we talked about them. I told you it was a strange gig.

# Lead Foresight Researcher, BBC R&D

In 2022, I was given the opportunity to make a long-standing research interest in futures & foresight methodologies into a full-time role at [BBC R&D](#bbc-rd) in the newly-formed Advisory Team. The Team's remit as a whole is to keep an eye on emerging technologies and advise the BBC on how they might impact on the business and the lives of our audiences. I built a team to work on foresight activites, designed working practises which enabled us to operationalise foresight methodologies as part of our day-to-day work, and led the production of two major foresight reports, along with generally providing foresight support and insight to the rest of the Advisory Team.

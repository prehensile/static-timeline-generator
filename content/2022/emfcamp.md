# Electromagnetic Field 2022

I was one of the Art & Installations Team Leads for EMF2022. Responsibilities included running and recruiting to the team, artist scouting and outreach, coordinating an Arts Council funding bid, curation, artist comms, and helping to set up and maintain installations and look after the artists during the festival.

# East London Kinetics 

In August 2013, I founded East London Kinetics (ELK), a physical / digital design studio with Tim Burrell-Saward.

We worked in physical product design, creative software development, embedded electronics and interaction design to create objects and spaces that sense and react to the world around them.

We built things that that tell stories.

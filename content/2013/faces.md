# Faces in The Cloud

An ongoing, automated exploration of machine pareidolia which ran from January 2013 - October 2015. 

_Pareidolia in humans is a perceptual tic peculiar to the way our nervous systems evolved: it’s better to assume an unidentified shape in the bushes as a hungry tiger rather than a funny-shaped bush. Machines don’t have that genetic baggage: what do these images reveal about the unevennesses in their perceptual model of the world? How does pareidolia work when it’s a mode of pareidolia arising from machine perception?_

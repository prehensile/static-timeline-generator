# The Throne at Game of Crowns

Created as the focal point of a month long Christmas 2013 event at Kensington Palace curated by legendary games designers Hide&Seek, the Throne was designed to offer visitors a magical, fairytale experience: the opportunity to be crowned under a title of their own creation.

Each visitor was given an empty title board which they then filled with a choice of over one hundred different adjectives, titles and places. They then walked the red carpet and took their place on the throne. Thirteen golden trumpets then sounded a royal fanfare, with coloured streamers shooting out of each. A regal voice then emanated from the throne, presenting the visitor to the crowd using their chosen title. And there was much rejoicing.

This was a project built with Tim Burrell-Saward as ELK. I wrote the software which ran the installation, designed the technical platform, worked with Tim on the electronics and did the majority of the digital experience design.

# Early Days (of a better nation)

In 2013, I participated in an Ideas Lab at Kings College, London. The Lab brought together creative technologists, arts and cultural organisations and academic researchers.

I ended up working with Coney, an interactive theatre company, on their fledgling show Early Days (of a better nation). In a team with two other technologists, we set about building a prototype system to allow remote audience members to interact meaningfully with events and people in a live theatre space.

However! I wasn't writing software for long. Not long into the project, it became clear that we had a communication problem: the artists and technologists couldn't understand each other. Our artistic partners were talking about _beats_ and _narrative_ and how they wanted the audience to _feel_. The technologists just wanted a list of features to implement. 

I took it upon myself to meet with the theatre makers at Coney, taking time to understand what they wanted to achieve with the prototype. I then spent some more time translating that into a set of requirements that the developers could build. I spent the rest of the project sitting in this in-between role, helping the artists and technologists understand one another, unblocking our communications.

It was a formative project for me, and one which set me on the path of being a glue person, enabling artists and technologists to work together effectively. Something which is an important part of my practise today.

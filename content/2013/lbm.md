# The London Bookshop Map

An iPhone app built for the publishers of the lovely London Bookshop Map. The app shows users the nearest independent bookshop to their current location in London, and allows them to search for specialisms including art, children’s, secondhand and many more.

The app also features a commission by artist Dora García. Choose to generate a story and it will be added to her ongoing project Twenty-three million, five hundred and eighty-six thousand, four hundred and ninety stories (2013–ongoing).

I built the app, collaborating with the map's designers to keep the app's design faithful to the printed map. I also collaborated with Dora García to create the story generator.

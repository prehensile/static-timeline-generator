# BBC Research & Development

I initially joined BBC R&D as a freelance creative techologist, working on experience prototypes for a content analysis, discovery, and recommendation system. I liked it so much I stayed, and joined full-time in 2016, working as a technologist, producer, and researcher. I pivoted to foresight research in my last few years there, and left at the end of 2024. 

Highlights included designing and leading a [discovery and prototyping project on voice interfaces](#talking-machines), a [follow-up on audio AR](#audio-ar), becoming [a published author](#browsing), and [leading our first futures and foresight reports](#projections).

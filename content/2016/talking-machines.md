# Talking With Machines

Talking With Machines was the first project I led at BBC R&D. We were interested in the emerging category of voice devices and interfaces, spearheaded by Amazon with their Echo device, and Alexa.

We obtained a developer version of the Echo, and I made some quick prototypes to get a feel for the interactions and capabilities of the device.

I then designed a project to explore voice devices. It was a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, we'd be making working prototypes to understand how the devices worked, and on the other we'd be doing design research and devising a set of UI guidelines to help others around the BBC and elswhere make things.

The project was a great success: we created protypes and guidelines that laid the groundwork for the BBC's later work on these devices, as well as releasing public-facing protoypes that established the BBC in the space and led the way for other creators and publishers. Years later, people still tell me that the guidelines we released help them to create work for these platforms!

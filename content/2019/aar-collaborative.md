# Designing an Interactive and Collaborative Experience in Audio Augmented Reality

_Bauer, V. et al. (2019)_

Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) consists of adding spatial audio entities into the real environment. Existing mobile applications and technologies open questions around interactive and collaborative AAR. This paper proposes an experiment to examine how spatial audio can prompt and support actions in interactive AAR experiences; how distinct auditory information influence collaborative tasks and group dynamics; and how gamified AAR can enhance participatory storytelling.

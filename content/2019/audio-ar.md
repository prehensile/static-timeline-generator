# Audio AR

The second large research and prototyping project I led at BBC R&D.

We noticed that spatial audio, locative audio and audio AR were starting to appear in consumer-level technology. Much like our previous project on voice devices, I initiated a project which would explore the material properties of the available consumer hardware and do design research to devise UX guidelines.

We produced one immersive storytelling prototype in-house and hosted a second project by two PhD students from Queen Mary's University in London which explored group and embodied interactions in an augmented audio space.

# Punchdrunk: Audience of the Future

Towards the end of 2019, I took a short sabbatical from the BBC to work on a research and prototyping project for legendary immersive theatre company Punchdrunk.

Our brief was to investigate possible technologies for keeping track of audience members during a show, creating little personal moments using that data, and structures for self-running game-like set-pieces. We ended up delivering a scratch show, through which an audience member's journey touched on demonstators of these technical possibilities.

I was technical lead on the project and recruited a team of specialists to work on various aspects of the show and its enabling technologies. I architected and wrote the overall system and backend which ran the show, built the software and hardware to run one of the set-piece games and did a lot of work to pull the whole thing together, both technically and as a producer. I also built a number of small exploratory prototypes in the early stages of the project, was a key member of the show's creative team, and spent a not-insignificant amount of time acting as intepreter and mediator between creative, technical and design staff.

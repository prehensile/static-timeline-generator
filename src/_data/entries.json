These technologies included peripheral vision LED screens, sub-bass chairs, live heart-rate-to-sound conversion and projection mapping.</p>\n<p>In November 2015 the concept was developed into a breathtaking full performance which enjoyed a sold-out run at the Barbican in London and was described by The Guardian as &quot;a seat-shaking, soul-searching techno-futurist experience&quot;.</p>\n",

The Lab brought together creative technologists, arts and cultural organisations and academic researchers.</p>\n<p>I ended up working with Coney, an interactive theatre company, on their fledgling show Early Days (of a better nation). In a team with two other technologists, we set about building a prototype system to allow remote audience members to interact meaningfully with events and people in a live theatre space.</p>\n<p>However! I wasn&#39;t writing software for long. Not long into the project, it became clear that we had a communication problem: the artists and technologists couldn&#39;t understand each other. Our artistic partners were talking about <em>beats</em> and <em>narrative</em> and how they wanted the audience to <em>feel</em>. The technologists just wanted a list of features to implement. </p>\n<p>I took it upon myself to meet with the theatre makers at Coney, taking time to understand what they wanted to achieve with the prototype. I then spent some more time translating that into a set of requirements that the developers could build. I spent the rest of the project sitting in this in-between role, helping the artists and technologists understand one another, unblocking our communications.</p>\n<p>It was a formative project for me, and one which set me on the path of being a glue person, enabling artists and technologists to work together effectively.

They didn&#39;t just want a simple ebook - they wanted something that would use the affordances of the device to make something that felt native to the phone.</p>\n<p>The concept of the book was that one of the show&#39;s main characters, Malcolm Tucker, had left a folder full of sensitive documents on a train. The book was the illict contents of this folder.</p>\n<p>After a few phone calls thinking about how to approach the brief, I came up with the idea of translating the concept of the book to something that would make sense on an iPhone. If the book simulated the experience of finding a folder full of paper documents, maybe the app should simulate the experience of finding Malcolm&#39;s phone?</p>\n<p>It was one of those beautiful ideas which completely unlocks a project. From there, the rest of the design just flowed. We reformatted material from the book into emails, text messages and file attachments. Members of the cast recorded new material as voicemails, and then we added our crowning achievement - a story engine which, when triggered, would play out the storyline of Malcolm trying to get his phone back over a couple of days of the user&#39;s real time, using notifications to send new voicemails, emails and messages.</p>\n<p>The app was wildly successful - people loved the feel of rifling through a fictional character&#39;s phone, and the experience of living through a realtime, personal story. We had loads of great reviews, and in 2011 it became the first app to be nominated for a TV BAFTA.</p>\n<p>I was sole developer on the project and led its creative development.</p>\n",

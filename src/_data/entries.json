We ended up delivering a scratch show, through which an audience member&#39;s journey touched on demonstators of these technical possibilities.</p>\n<p>I was technical lead on the project and recruited a team of specialists to work on various aspects of the show and its enabling technologies. I architected and wrote the overall system and backend which ran the show, built the software and hardware to run one of the set-piece games and did a lot of work to pull the whole thing together, both technically and as a producer. I also built a number of small exploratory prototypes in the early stages of the project, was a key member of the show&#39;s creative team, and spent a not-insignificant amount of time acting as intepreter and mediator between creative, technical and design staff.</p>\n",
